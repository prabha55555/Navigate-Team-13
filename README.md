## Project Structure

### Backend

The backend is built with Node.js and provides RESTful APIs for all platform functionalities.

```
backend/
├── server.js                 # Main server file
├── api/                      # API route definitions
├── controllers/              # Business logic controllers
├── middlewares/              # Custom middleware (authentication, etc.)
├── models/                   # Database models
├── services/                 # Service layer for business logic
└── uploads/                  # File upload storage
```

### Frontend

The frontend is built with React and provides separate interfaces for instructors and students.

```
frontend/
├── public/                   # Static assets
└── src/
    ├── components/           # Reusable UI components
    ├── contexts/             # React contexts for state management
    ├── pages/                # Page components for different routes
    ├── services/             # API service integrations
    └── styles/               # CSS and styling files
```

### AI Services

Specialized AI services that power the platform's intelligent features.

```
ai_services/
├── adaptive_learning/        # Personalized learning path algorithms
├── assessment/               # Question generation and evaluation
├── expert_panel/             # Expert knowledge integration
├── models/                   # AI model implementations
